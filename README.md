# Transmission-of-a-Morse-signal-to-a-Raspberry-Pi-device
This is my Diploma Project from 2021, entitled "Transmission of a Morse signal to a Raspberry Pi device".
<br>
A message is typed by the user on the laptop, then it is sent via radio interface to a Raspberry Pi, where the message is stored in a database
and the message is played on a buzzer.
<br>
Two USRP modules equipped with antennas were used to facilitate the transmission and reception. Scripts and functionality of the radio blocks were written in
Python. MariaDB was chosen as the server database. Some Bash scripts were built to combine the different components.
